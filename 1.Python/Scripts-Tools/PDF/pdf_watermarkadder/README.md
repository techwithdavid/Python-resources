# PDF Watermaker 

### Getting started: 
- To begin with you will have to download the required modules. You can do this by doing:
    `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- After that make sure to keep the pdf you want to add the watermark to, is in the same directory as the python script.
- After executing the program it will ask you for: 
    -- The Text you want to use as a watermark
    -- The name of the pdf file you want to add the watermark to
- The script will save the final file by the name finalDraft.pdf

- Example result :

![Img](./images/img1.png =250x) ![Img](./images/img2.png =250x)
