## Detecting Geometrical shapes in an image using OpenCV  
### What is Contours?

Contours can be explained simply as a curve joining all the continuous points (along the boundary), having the same color or intensity.
The contours are a useful tool for shape analysis and object detection and recognition.

### Why we discussing about contours?
We will be using Contours to first find the curving of object, then will be checkin and naming about shape of it depending on sides of object.

## Approach : 
The approach we would use to detect the shape of a given polygon will be based on classifying the detected shape on the basis of a number of sides it has.
For example, if the detected polynomial has 3 sides, then it could be considered as a triangle, if the polynomial has 4 sides then it could be classified as a square or a rectangle, and so on.

### Important :  
Please add the image you want to use this on in the same folder you are saving the code, or else add the whole location.

## Language used : Python


## Libraries used: 
1. OpenCV
2. Numpy
