# Color Detection

This is a python script which we can use to determine the color of a part of image.

## Installation

* Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install Opencv.

```bash
pip install opencv-python
``` 
* Install Numpy

```bash
pip install numpy
```
* Install Pandas

```bash
pip install pandas
```

## How it works

* When the user double clicks on the image, then color of that part of image is shown in a box.
