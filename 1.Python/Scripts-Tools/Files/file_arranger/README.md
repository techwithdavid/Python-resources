# File Arranger

Put this python file into the folder you want to arrange and then execute.

You can also execute it via terminal by passing the full path to this.

```folder\you\want\to\execute>python path\to\file_arranger\file_arranger.py```

You may also just run the ```file_arraner.exe``` if you're on windows.
