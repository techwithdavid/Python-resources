# Zip Extractor

## Setup and activate virtual environment :
For Unix based systems please execute the following command to create venv and install requirements.
```
make init
source .venv/bin/activate
```

    1. Download the code
    2. Setup and activate virtual environment
    3. Run the code with python

    *Download Python from: https://python.org/downloads/*
    Make sure that python is added to path in your environment variables.
    After this, open command prompt in the folder where you extracted the code.
    Type `make init` and press enter.
    Then run the code and follow the prompts.
    

    *Caution*: Currently I am using Python 3.7 version in my machine, so the library named zipfile is installed
    using command "pip install zipfile37". Here 37 refers to the version. If your python version is other than
    3.7, then I would recommend you to check the version and type the respective number there.

    **Thank you**
