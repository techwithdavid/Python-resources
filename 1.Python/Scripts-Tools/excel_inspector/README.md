# Overall

It provides an overview of excel spreadsheets from pandas so no need to click to open them :-)

## What does it print?

- It loops through each spreadsheet (.xlsx) of a folder and prints the filename
- It opens the spreadsheet and prints the total number of sheets and their names
- It parse the sheets one by one as dataframes and prints info

### Feel free to expand on it with whatever else you would like the inspector to print out!
