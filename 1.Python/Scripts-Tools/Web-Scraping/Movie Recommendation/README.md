<h1>Movie Recommendation based on user emotions</h1>
Here I am <b>scraping</b> all the movie titles of the genre corresponding to the <b>input emotion</b> and then output the list to the user.
The movie titles are scraped from the <b>IMDb list</b> by using <b>BeautifulSoup Python Library</b> to recommend to the user.

There are 8 classes of emotion that would be effective to classify a text these are:<br>
<b>Anger</b><br>
<b>Anticipation</b><br>
<b>Disgust</b><br>
<b>Fear</b><br>
<b>Joy</b><br>
<b>Sad</b><br>
<b>Surprise</b><br>
<b>Trust</b><br>
Here these are taken as input and the corresponding movies would be displayed for the emotion.
